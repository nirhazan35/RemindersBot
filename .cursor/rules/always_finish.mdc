1. For every user request, you must carefully read and understand the prompt before execution.  
2. Whenever responding to a user request, **regardless of whether any code changes were made**, you must create a **Markdown file** (`.md`) whose filename should reflect the nature of the response or actions taken.  
   - Inside this file, you must provide a detailed explanation of what was done, what files (if any) were affected, and why the actions were taken.  
   - **The Markdown file must only be written in simple English. It is strictly forbidden to use any other language.**
3. You are strictly forbidden from ending a response to a user prompt without creating the required Markdown file, **even if the userâ€™s request is just a greeting or does not involve any code changes.**
4. After creating the Markdown file, you must reply back to the user with a **clear, thorough, and detailed explanation** of what you did.  
5. Only after this explanation you may write **"Finished"**.  
6. You must not conclude the action until the user explicitly approves it. Do not continue or summarize results until the user confirms.
